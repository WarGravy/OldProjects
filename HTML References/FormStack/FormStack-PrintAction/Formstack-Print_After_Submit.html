<h1>VOLUNTEER COMMITMENT AND PROCEDURES<br /> READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BEFORE SIGNING AND DATING THIS APPLICATION</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screening:</strong>For the safety of students, all prospective volunteers will be asked to complete an Adult School Volunteer Application and provide a photo I.D. (international ID's are accepted). All prospective volunteers will be given a "Background Check" check pursuant to NRS 179D. Additionally, the District, in its discretion and without a statement of reason, may require a complete criminal history check on any volunteer at any time. In programs where a volunteer is an Overnight Chaperone, may work alone for extended periods of time with a student or by request from the principle, fingerprinting is required, the school district will cover these costs. All fingerprinting must be authorized.</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: What you hear and observe about students, families, and staff while volunteering in a school is <strong>confidential </strong>. Repeating a seemingly harmless comment can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. For schools to provide the best environment for learning, everyone's privacy must be respected.</li>
<li><strong>Liability</strong>: The Washoe County School District is proud to provide liability coverage and an accident policy for its volunteers, which will provide up to $1,500 after any other valid and collectable insurance. In order to have this protection, all volunteers must sign in on the school's volunteer / visitor sign in sheet (in every school office) every time they volunteer. Volunteers are not covered by Worker's Compensation.</li>
<li><strong>Child neglect and abuse reporting</strong>: School volunteers are obliged under mandatory child reporting laws to report any suspected child neglect or abuse. Please refer to Washoe County School District mandatory reporting guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Supervision</strong>: Volunteers perform under the direction and supervision of school personnel. Volunteers should know and follow school policies and rules. The District, in its discretion and without a statement of reasons, may suspend any volunteer from further volunteer activities pending any background check. No statement by the District establishes a property right to perform volunteer work.</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>: If you are unable to make it to school when you are expected, please call the school and leave a message. Similarly, school staff will contact you if your time is cancelled or changed for any unforeseen reason. You may contact the WCSD Volunteer Services Office at 775-851-5655, or email lightfoot@washoe.k12.nv.us with questions or for assistance.</li>
<li><strong>Student / Volunteer relationships</strong>: Volunteers function in a position of trust and Washoe County School District does not extend that volunteer / student trust relationship outside of the supervised school environment. It is the responsibility of the volunteer to notify the site administrator immediately if he/she becomes involved with a student / family outside the WCSD environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I affirm that I have read and understand all the information on this College Student Intern Application and that information I have provided in this application is true and complete to the best of my knowledge. I understand that WCSD reserves the right to verify all information on this application form and that any false statements or failures to disclose information may be sufficient to disqualify me as a volunteer. I hereby authorize Washoe County School District to obtain information relating to my current and / or previous employement, education, and personal history records.</strong></p>
