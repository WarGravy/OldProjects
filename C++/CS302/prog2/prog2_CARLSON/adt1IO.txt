adt1_IO
Zachary Carlson

There is very no input required by the user when adt1 is being tested. The driver will run through all of the possible scenarios, and since there is an outputToFile function, there is a TESTschedule.txt file which can be viewed to view the outputToFile function. The Output to the terminal should be like this:
