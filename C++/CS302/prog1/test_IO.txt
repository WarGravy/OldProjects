Test Plan:
The ADT test driver tests all of the functions and if it does it properly, it should do it in the following order:

1.	insertAtEnd (It tests this function 3 times with 3 different structs.)
2.	search(It tests it once, searching for the product number inputted by the user, if the user searches for 1111, 2222, or 3333)
3.	getItem ( It will print the product info from the last search after it retrieves it.)
4.	print (This is testing the function with an inventory)
5.	clear(nothing is outputted to know if this works correctly, so step 5 serves two purposes; printing an empty inventory and if it does that we know that clear worked properly.)
6.	print (This is testing the function with an empty inventory)

//OUTPUT TO TERMINAL: 
TESTING FUNCTION insertAtEnd
Boolean response to adding object1 to inventory: 1
Boolean response to adding object2 to inventory: 1
Boolean response to adding object2 to inventory: 1
Function works!
//INPUT TO TERMINAL:
 1111
//OUTPUT TO TERMINAL:
TESTING FUNCTION getItem and printed that item to screen
Product Number: 1111|Price: 10.12|Tax: N|Description: AAAAAAAAAAAA
