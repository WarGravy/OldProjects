My Old Projects
========
Most of these projects are from previous classes from my time spent as an undergraduate at the University of Nevada, Reno. I decided to keep many of these and organize them by language for reference.

Warning
========
The C++ folder contains much older code from my freshmen and early sophomore year so some of the code may not actually work. Since there is so much in the C++ folder I still need to filter out the quality code to keep as reference. This does not apply for any of the other languages.
